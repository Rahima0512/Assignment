Hii so let me quickly deep dive into my ongoing project. Required technologies for the project are HTML, CSS, and javascript.
The main idealogy behind this project is creating a health card that could be carried along everywhere so that whether it is our regular check-up or an emergency situation our health record could be accessed with just a scan. Whether we are busy with our hectic schedule or our old aged parents living far away they could just carry this everywhere and in case of any mishappening this card could be scanned and the information could be retrieved.

•	I have written code in such a way that it could be used and understood by any working professional so if someone else is going to develop a certain part of the project it would not be difficult. So it could be well versed I could be a good team member.

•	Moving on to the front end part which is nearly done.

•	We have this navbar here through which we could easily navigate to a certain section of our website.
•	here is a bit intro to our website.
•	Moving ahead we have this log-in or sign-up option
•	then we have this section which tells about us
•	Moving ahead we have a step-by-step guide to tell users how to use the website.
•	We have this book now option if the user wants to book an appointment.
•	Then we have some client reviews
•	Then we have this section which would contain info about all our latest updates.
•	I have also done half of the signup page which is still in progress and would be soon completed.
•	Also to add this website runs equally beautiful on our mobile phone console here is a look at how it would look on mobile.
